Early morning yellow flowers,
thinking abuot
the drunkards of Mexico.

No telegram today
only more leavs
fell.

Nightfall,
boy smashing danddelions
with a stick.

Holding up my
purring cat to teh moon
I sighed.

Drunk as a hoot owl,
writing letters
by thundrestrom.

Empty baseball field
a robin
hops alongg the bench.

Elephants munching
on grass - loviing
Head side by side.

Missing a kick
at teh icebox door
It closed anyway.

This July evening,
a large frog
On my door sill.

Catfish fighting for his life,
and #winning,
Splashing us all.

I am nobody:
A red sinking autumn sun
Took my name away.

Keep straight down this block,
Then turn right where you will find
A peach tree blooming.

Make up you mind, Snail!
You are half inside your house,
And halfway out!

You moths must leave now;
I am turning out the light
And going to sleep.

All right, You Sparrows;
The sun has set and you can now
Stop your chattering!

Sparrow's excrement
Becomes quickly powdery
On sizzling pavements.

The dog's violent sneeze
Fails to rouse a single fly
On his mangy back.

On winter mornings
The candle shows faint markings
Of the teeth of rats.

With a twitching nose
A dog reads a telegram
On a wet tree trunk.

Sticking to my sweaty face
In the dusty woods.
